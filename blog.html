            <h3>Introduction </h3>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my Blog where I will be discussing my journey throughout this course.
                Website design is not something that I would say is new to me as I have created some in 6th form and also for my mums charity where I used webpage design websites.
            </p>

            <p>
                This was different as we coded the entire website which I enjoyed doing more than I  thought I would. We used a program called visual studio to code our website. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I had some bugs with my code but each time I persevered I felt like I became a better coder and also more aware of how I can tailor things I make and my designs to make it more appealing.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Research
            </h3>
            <p>
                I had to do some reading to find out what designs I should incorporate into my website.
                 I saw that colourblind people are able to read easier when the colours contrast more so I tried to keep this in mind with my colours.
                  But I didnâ€™t want to use a simple black and white so instead I used black and beige which has a softer tone with an eye-catching red background. 
            </p>
